# Game of Thrones Battle

## Description

+ Game that utilizes jQuery for DOM manipulation. The player chooses a character to fight as, and then a character to fight with.
+ Win Scenario: Defeat all opponents.
+ Lose Scenario: Lose a match.

### Target User

+ Any GoT fan that has a few moments to kill.

### Stretch Goals

+ More characters to choose from.
+ Refined character attributes (the game still has serious balance issues).

### Demo

+ This is what the user is presented with upon loading the page.


### Challenges Faced / Lessons Learned

+ Implementing music in a way that wasn't too obtrusive was difficult.
+ Music and sound effects in general took some Google-Fu to get a handle on implementation.

### Next Steps

+ Website currently has sluggish load times. Would like to speed that up.

### Final Notes

This was a fun project to put together. I would like to understand more about game balance as far as character hp, ap, etc. It's a challenge all by itself.
